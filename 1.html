<h2>5 Mother Sauce란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/mother-sauces-996119"
  targer="_blank" title="how to make">The five mother sauces</a> include
 <strong>béchamel sauce, veloute sauce, brown or
   <u>Espagnole sauce,</u>
Hollandaise sauce and tomato sauce.</strong></p>

<p>The fifth mother sauce is the classic Tomate sauce. This sauce resembles the traditional tomato sauce that we might use on pasta and pizza, but it's got much more flavor and requires a few more steps to make.
First, we render salt pork and then sauté aromatic vegetables.

Traditionally, the tomate sauce was thickened with roux, and some chefs still prepare it this way. But the tomatoes themselves are enough to thicken the sauce.</p>
